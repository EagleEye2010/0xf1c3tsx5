  <h1>Taiwan Mission Trip</h1>
  <br>
  - We went to Chiang Kai Shek memorial in Taipei, just after stepping foot in Taiwan.

  - When we arrived in Hualien (花莲), we got to go to Toroko Gorge, just one of the beautiful national parks in Taiwan.
  <br>

  <br>
  - This is one of the traditional Taiwanese temples, which we got to go to. There is much evil within, but that means ripe gospel oppurtunities.

  <br>
  - Two intresting cultural differences are shown here, if you look closely, everyone on stage is wearing socks. The dancer on stage is normal in Taiwan (but not for us lol).

  - After spending our time in Hualien with the Kleinerts, we got to go to the east side of the Island, Taichung (台中). This is a picture of us when we arrived at the train station.

  <br>

  <br>
  - We got to go to the DMZ, which is essentially the border between North Korea and South Korea.
  <br>

  <br>
  - Picture of North Korea.
  <br>
  <img src="">
  <br>
  - We got to try traditional Korean food, it had a long name that I could neither pronounce or spell.
  <br>

  <br>
  - We went to the top of Seoul Tower, and it is amazing to see how many people live here and how prosperous it is, compared to it's neighbor, North Korea.
  <br>

  <br>
  - We also got to go to the night market in Seoul as well. When they say spicy, they mean it!
